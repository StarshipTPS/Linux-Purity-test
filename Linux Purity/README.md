Hello! I see you have found yourself the greatest Linux purity test in the history of the universe! If you are wondering just how pure a Linux user you are, you've come to the right place!


**DISCLAIMER**: This is just for fun! Please don't takethis too seriously! This is a fan-made project thought up just for laughs.


Prerequesites: I wrote this in Python so you will need to install Python 3 (If you haven't already).


on Debian/Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6

on Fedora/RedHat:

$ sudo dnf install python3

on Arch and Arch-based distros:

$ sudo pacman -S python




If you don't know how to run:
cd to the main directory
run

$ python3 linuxpurity.py

and it should launch.



At the time, this is just going to be a CLI interface. At somepoint in the future I will change it to a GUI, but my computer would start smoking if I tried to code that. Just this simple program caused it to crash about thirty times!


Also the tux folder has no malware. It is just a page of the word 'tux' repeated over and over. Go look if you want.
